# html-102 :fire:

Simple exercise:

1. Create a new local project (on your laptop) called e.g. 'html-102'
1. Create a new remote repository on **your** github called e.g. 'html-102' and connect it with your local project
1. Create a new project with this structure

```
html-102
│    
│   index.html    
└───assets
    │
    └───css
    │       style.css
    └───images
            bandit.png

```

Your project (local/remote) should look like https://github.com/LeandroDCI/html-102
(copy the content of the index.html and style.css - copy the bandit.png image )

Options:
- You can download the zip from this repository and copy the files to your project 
- You can clone this repository and copy the files to your project  
- You can do whatever you want but copy those files!!! :alien: 


**Note:** 
if you already have a github repository for your DCI exercises you can create this project structure in your existing repository! :+1:
